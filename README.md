# sql_table_enemies
1. Write an SQL statement that creates a table 'Enemies' that holds the enemies the player encounters in the game. Use datatypes appropriate for SQL. The table should have the following columns: EnemyID, Name, Location, Hit points, Attack, Defense, and ItemID (for whatever item an enemy drops when defeated)
2.Write an SQL statement that creates a table 'Items' that holds items a player can use in the game. It should have the following columns: ItemID, Name, and Type.
3.What is the primary key and what is the foreign key in the 'Enemies' table?
4.Write one SQL statement for each table that inserts one of the entries from the HW9 excel spreadsheet into the respective table.
5.Write an SQL query that returns the names of all enemies that drop food items (you need to join both tables here).

6. Put the queries and statements into proper Java code, as shown in the examples in the Powerpoints.
